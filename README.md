# Indic Transcriber
## A model to transcribe speech to text specifically tuned to Indian accents.
  - Uses the asr library from [here](https://github.com/rolczynski/Automatic-Speech-Recognition).
  - Currently attempts to modify pre-trained models.
## Code
  - Currently, only helper code present in the repository.
  - Updates to the model code to be done iteratively, after completion of each goal.
    - Model code currently in colab.

## TODO:
