# Indic Transcriber
## A model to transcribe speech to text specifically tuned to Indian accents.
### Experiments
  - Make-your-own model (Seq-2-Seq/transformer)
  - Use the asr library from [here](https://github.com/rolczynski/Automatic-Speech-Recognition).
  - Attempt to modify pre-trained models.
## Code
  - Currently, only helper code present in the repository.
  - Updates to the model code to be done iteratively, after completion of each goal.
    - Model code currently in colab.

## TODO:
  - Actually go about implementing this and start pushing more code!
